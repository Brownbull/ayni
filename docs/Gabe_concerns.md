We previously tried to develop the project using the current architecture and PRD documentation but we quickly found some issues with the current approach so I would like to adjust it a little bit.

First the Tailwind integration against Chakra. Chakra is the common default for the Fast API framework that we are cloning and using Tailwind seems to be in conflict with Chakra. So I will need to use Chakra only at the beginning and leave Tailwind migration for later stages. Do not include any Tailwind script at the beginning; that will be a later integration in the workflow. Just after we implemented the core features for the MVP, we will be maybe thinking about migrating to Tailwind. That's one concern.

The other concern is that we deploy fast. We will first create the platform, the backend and frontend. Backend in Fast API and frontend on React. But I would also like to once we have the local setup ready proceed with the deployment in Railway for Fast API and on Render for React and connect those two and make them work. Test them and make them work early. I would like this to be part of the initial setup somehow so we don't develop a huge platform that then we try to deploy and we find a lot of issues. No, I would like to create a platform, test it locally with a very basic setup first and then proceed immediately with deployment and resolve any issues during deployment. After that we can proceed with changes and tests locally and once they are ready for deployment we proceed with deployment and so on. We do incremental deployments in the remote locations but from the beginning we don't delay that to later stages. We start early with deployment testing.

One more concern that we kind of solved in the previous iteration is the use of Playwright and using Chrome Development Tools to test the UI. There were several instances where the platform was supposed to be ready but when I as a user try to access the platform locally, I got errors or blank pages. This is indication of issues in the builds of the page. So instead of assuming that the front-end is okay we should verify with UI testing (Playwright or Chrome Development Tools) that the page is actually loading what we expect to be loading.
