## 3. Behavioral Insights

### Technology Adoption Patterns

**SMB Retail SaaS Adoption Behavior:**
- **Discovery**: Google search > Word-of-mouth > LinkedIn ads > Trade shows
- **Trial**: 83% start with free trial before buying [Source: Market Research]
- **Purchase Cycle**: 1-2 weeks (NOT enterprise 6-month cycle)
- **Buying Committee**: Owner + Operations Manager (2 people max)
- **Budget**: Monthly expense, not CapEx (no CFO approval needed)

**Chilean-Specific Behaviors:**
- **Payment Preference**: Credit card (44% of e-commerce) or digital wallets
- **Language**: Spanish required, English okay as secondary
- **Support Hours**: Chilean business hours (9am-6pm CLT)
- **Social Proof**: Local testimonials valued > international case studies
- **Relationship-Driven**: Personal relationships matter, cold sales harder

### Price Sensitivity

**Willingness to Pay Dynamics:**
- **$0-30/month**: "Easy yes" - low consideration
- **$30-75/month**: "Worth it if it saves time" - moderate consideration
- **$75-150/month**: "Needs clear ROI" - high consideration, may consult accountant
- **$150+/month**: "Too expensive" - most SMBs reject

**Reference Prices:**
- Accounting software: $30-70/month (they're paying this)
- POS system: $50-200/month (they're paying this)
- Our product: Should feel similar to these ($50-100 range)

**Budget Psychology:**
- SMBs think monthly, not annually (unlike enterprise)

- Thursday: Makes decision, upgrades
- Friday: Onboards team
