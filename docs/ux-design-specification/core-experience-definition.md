# Core Experience Definition

## The ONE Thing Users Do Most
**View company dashboard and monthly stats on principal location** - This is the daily/weekly ritual where users check their business health. The dashboard must load instantly and show meaningful insights at a glance.

## What Must Be Effortless
1. **Navigate statistics** - Moving between time periods, locations, and metrics should feel fluid
2. **Upload data** - The CSV upload process must be foolproof with smart column mapping

## Most Critical User Action
**Data upload with intelligent column mapping** - This is the make-or-break moment. Features needed:
- View first row preview to verify data
- Configure formats per column (date, int, float for amounts)
- Set default formats that persist
- Visual validation before processing

## Platform Priority
- **Desktop-first design** optimized for Chrome browser
- Mobile responsiveness as secondary consideration
- Focus on desktop power-user workflows initially

## Desired Emotional Response

**Competitive and motivated** - "I'm in the 68th percentile - let's get to top 25%!"

Users should feel they are:
- **Gaining control** of their business trajectory
- **Building awareness** that grows with each data upload
- **Understanding their position** relative to the market
- **Seeing the full picture** including external factors (buffs/debuffs) that impact performance
- **Freed from manual work** - no more sorting, aggregating, or making sense of raw transactions

The emotional journey: From overwhelmed → informed → competitive → motivated to improve. Each data upload makes them smarter, each dashboard view reveals opportunities, and the percentile ranking transforms business management into an engaging challenge.
