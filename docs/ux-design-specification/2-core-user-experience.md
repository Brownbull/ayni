# 2. Core User Experience

## 2.1 Defining Experience

**"It's the app that shows me how I rank against other businesses like mine"**

The core experience is **The Percentile Reveal** - that moment when users discover their competitive position. This transforms business metrics from abstract numbers into a competitive challenge.

**The Magic Moment:**
- User uploads their data
- System processes and aggregates
- Dashboard loads with a prominent **Performance Index**
- Animated reveal: "You rank in the 68th percentile"
- Color-coded tier appears (Green/Blue/Purple/Grey)
- Immediate understanding: "I'm doing better than 68% of similar businesses"

**Why This Defines Ayni:**
- **Unique differentiator** - No Chilean SMB tool shows competitive rankings
- **Emotional hook** - Triggers competitive motivation
- **Network effect** - Every new user makes rankings more valuable
- **Viral potential** - Users want to share/brag about high percentiles
- **Retention driver** - Users return to improve their "parse"

**UX Implications:**
- Percentile ranking must be **prominently displayed** on main dashboard
- Use **gaming-inspired visuals** (progress bars, tier colors, animations)
- Make rankings **shareable** (export images, social proof)
- Show **trend arrows** (improving or declining vs last period)
- Provide **clear path to improvement** (what moves the needle)
